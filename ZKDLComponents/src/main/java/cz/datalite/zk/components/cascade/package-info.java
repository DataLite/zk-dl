/**
 * If a component should change automatically according to some master component value, we call it cascade.
 * <p>Typical example is combobox cascade - select country and  then list of towns should refresh itself to show only towns from selected country.
  Currently only textbox and combobox implements CascadableComponent interface, but you can easily customize any component.</p>
