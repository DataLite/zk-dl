 * shown localizable button to cancel running operation. Default value is

 * <p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use this annotation with {@link ZkBlocking}. Both
 * annotations are considered to provide similar effect in different ways.</p>

     * <p>Some applications are written localizable. Usually the approach

     * This annotation also contains some texts which can be localized. This

     * to user or if it is only key into property file</p>
