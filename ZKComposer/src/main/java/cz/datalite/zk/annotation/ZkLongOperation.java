     * <p>Some applications are written localizable. Usually the approach
     * requires property file which contains pairs key-value where key is text
     * written in code and value is localized message which is shown to user.
     * This annotation also contains some texts which can be localized. This
     * attribute says if the text in the annotation is text to be directly shown
     * to user or if it is only key into property file</p>
     *
     * <p>If the attribute is false, then the text is directly shown without any
     * modification. If the attirbute is true then there is conversion to the
     * value through
     * {@link org.zkoss.util.resource.Labels#getLabel(java.lang.String)}. This
     * class reads all property files defined as language packs and provides
     * coorect translates.</p>

     * <p>Usage of this annotation attribute is highly reccomended for writing
     * some encapsulate component which can be distributed in stand-alone mode.
     * Otherwise <strong>this attribute is not comfortable for localization
     * whole application</strong>.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Project localization</h3> <p>For localization of whole application
     * the i18n can be activated in configuration file. The disadvantage of this
     * solution lies in impossibility of localy disabling i18n and each message
     * have to be localized. Application configuration file
     * <strong>zk.xml</strong> allows definining of library properties. Write in
     * this code to enable complete localization of Zk annotations {@link ZkException},
     * {@link ZkConfirm}.
